# giu [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/giu.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/giu)

## What?

A collection of React components and utilities.
**WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Why?

- Flexibility:
    + If you use the ES6 sources and Webpack 2, you can bundle only the components you need, nothing more. For example, if you `import Modal`, you will not embed Redux, which you will if you `import Modals`.
    + If you need a simple confirmation modal, use `Modal` directly. If you need stacked modals and more state control, include a `Modals` component at the top of your app and use the provided API. If you need even more control, use the exported `modalReducer` and `modalActions` (action creators) with your own application's Redux store. Same for `Notifications`and `Floats`.
    + In form components (`TextInput`, `Select`, `Textarea`...), choose whether you want giu to handle state for you (and then retrieve the component's value when e.g. the user clicks on Submit) or you want full control from outside.
    + Styles: lightweight styles are included for some components, but you can always customise the appearance including your own `style` attributes.
- Nice touches:
    + Textarea with auto-resize
    + Keyboard shortcuts, autofocus, default buttons on Modals
    + Sticky/retainable notifications
- Completeness:
    + Basic components: Button, Icon, Spinner, LargeMessage...
    + Form components: TextInput, NumberInput, Select, Textarea, Checkbox...
    + Not-so-basic ones: Modal(s), Notification(s)...
    + Higher-order components: Hoverable
    + Style helpers: ...
    + Other helpers: ...

## How?

### Installation

```
$ npm install --save-dev giu
```

It is recommended to include **giu** among your `devDependencies`, since 


### Higher-order components (HOCs)

Example usage:

```js
import { hoverable } from 'giu';
import { Component } from 'react';

class MyReactComponent extends Component {
    /* ... */
}

export default hoverable(MyReactComponent);
```

HOCs also work fine with functional React components.

#### Hoverable
