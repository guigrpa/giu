# Roadmap

Long-standing:
- [ ] ListPicker: if not focused, it should not scrollintoview! But don't use fFocused (draws a border). Add a new `fParentFocused` and use it for this purpose. Dropdownmenus should stop scrolling also if keyboard shortcuts are used
- [ ] Focus delegation?
- [ ] Multi-selection ListPicker
- [ ] Drag and drop
- [ ] Include SVG font?
