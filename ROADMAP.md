- [ ] Add validation hook to inputs; return an error or an array of errors

- [ ] Hints
- [ ] Pressing enter on button opening a modal also dismisses the modal!
- [ ] Add alternative style to inputs (no borders, etc.) or make it simple to wrap the provided components and customise
- [ ] Multi-selection ListPicker:
- [ ] Design customisation strategy for theme constants (context? constant modification?) -- reduce to the minimum the style-related props (one color), so that we don't need to handle that!
- [ ] Drag and drop
- [ ] Include SVG font?
- [ ] DOCS!
